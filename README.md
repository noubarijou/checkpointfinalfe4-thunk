### Notes

The base code for the project was built on react 17
This project was made from scratch, using react 18
It was done in collaboration
My CSS is crap, but I can live with that
The base code had multiple CSS files - almost one for each tsx file
I put all my CSS in index.css
The base code was basically all divs
I tried to apply a more semantic set of tags to my code
